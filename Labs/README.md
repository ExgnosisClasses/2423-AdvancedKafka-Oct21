# Lab Repo for Advanced Kafka

This is a subset of the main class repository [Advanced Kafka](https://github.com/ExgnoRepos/2423-AdvancedKafka-Oct21) containing only the lab files. Everything in this repository is also in the main repository.

This repository has been set tup so that you can clone only the lab material into your VM and not the slides and other materials.

It will be deleted after class on October 24.
