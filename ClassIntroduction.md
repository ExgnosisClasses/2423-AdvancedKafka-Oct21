## Class Protocols

- Please feel free to ask questions at any time. If you wait, you may forget details about what you wanted to ask.
- If you know that you will be absent or late, please advise me in advance, so I don't hold up the class waiting for you.
- At various points, I will go through the class list and ask you for feedback on how you are doing and how well you are understanding the material. Take this opportunity to identify any content you need me to explain further or go over again.
