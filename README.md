# Advanced Kafka Repository

This is the class repository for the Advanced kafka Class Oct 21-24, 2024.

***Update: This repo is moving to [New Advanced Kafka](https://github.com/ExgnosisClasses/2423-AdvancedKafka-Oct21)***

- The new repository will be accessible from October 25 until November 25, 2024
- The old repository will be available until November 1
- This is due to a general github account repurposing.


### Lab Repository

The lab code and guides are duplicated in a separate repository for a lightweight clone of just the lab materials into your working VM. This is located at:

[Advanced Kafka Labs](https://github.com/ExgnoRepos/2423-Kafka-Labs)

Everything in the lab repository is also in this repository.
